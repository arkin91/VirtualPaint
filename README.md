#VirtualPaint - A simple paint program, using the openCV library

18/5 - Uses colour and contour detection to detect pens of certain colours, and then paint those colours as the user moves the pen around. All methods are in class NewWebcam, in the file proj1.py. Run via the proj1main.py file.
20/5 - added newclass.py (name to be changed). Will be used to allow user to store a color of their own choice to detect and paint with
21/5 - improved naming scheme of class and methods. Still some improvements needed here though.
